# ARM Processor 
## General
- Based on ARMv3 ISA based Processor 
- This code is written in 2 languages: VHDL/Verilog
- The finalised ARM processor code is in Lab 4
- There are READMEs / Lab Briefings in almost every files for more information 

## Lab 1
- Nothing much related to creating ARM processor. Mostly connections to refresh memory  
- Basically connections/constraints etc

## Lab 2 
- Very basic ARM processor
- Non-pipelined, Single-cycle processor to test correctness of different modules

## Lab 3
- Very basic multiplier

## Lab 4
- Expanded ARM Processor supporting 16 Data Processing instructions --> See Section "A3.4 Data processing instructions" in page A3-9 to A3-11 (page 75) of ARM Architecture Reference Manual for the details of the instructions.
- Involves very simple Branch Prediction
- 5 stage Pipeline (with Control hazards)
- I removed the multiplier for simplicity
