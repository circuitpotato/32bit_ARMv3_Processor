Lab4_Presentation:
- read here first to understand the enhancements

assembly_files:
- look here to understand assembly code

Normal_PipelineWithHazards:
- implementation of pipeline with control hazards

PipelineWithHazard_BranchPrediction
- implementation of pipeline with control hazards + branch prediction 


Take note:
- TOP.bit is only in Normal_PipelineWithHazards because we need to demo 16 DP instructions [Can be oberserved through hardware]
- For PipelineWithHazard_BranchPrediction the instructions is used in simulation to showcase Branch Prediction operations [Use Simulation to Observe]
